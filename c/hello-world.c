   scanf()         â†’ Reads input from user (like "Enter a number:")
   fgets()         â†’ Reads full lines of input safely (strings with spaces)
   fopen()         â†’ Opens a file (returns a FILE pointer)
   fprintf()       â†’ Writes formatted output to a file (like printf but to file)
   fclose()        â†’ Closes an opened file
   malloc()        â†’ Allocates memory during runtime (dynamic memory)
   free()          â†’ Frees memory previously allocated with malloc
   struct          â†’ Defines custom data types with grouped variables
   typedef         â†’ Creates an alias for a data type
   for / while     â†’ Loops used for repeating actions
   if / else       â†’ Conditional logic for decision making
   switch/case     â†’ Simplified branching logic (like menu systems)
   #define         â†’ Creates macros/constants
   #include        â†’ Adds system or custom headers for functions and types

   BONUS:
   makefile        â†’ Used to compile multi-file projects automatically
   header files    â†’ Store reusable function declarations (.h files)
